# Amir Souhail  

**Engineer | Research & Development in Mechatronics | Soft Robotics | Additive Manufacturing**

I am an engineer from Pakistan, currently living and working in Italy, with a strong background in **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** (University of Bradford) and a Master’s in **Mechanical Engineering** specializing in soft robotics. I bridge the gap between **electronics**, **mechanical design**, and **software** to create cutting-edge robotic systems.

During my Master’s, I focused on **designing** soft robotic grippers for rehabilitation and material manipulation, igniting my passion for **flexible and adaptive robotic solutions**. At the Italian Institute of Technology, I advanced research on **variable stiffness in soft robotics**, including **3D modeling**, mechanical and thermal simulations, material testing, and electronics integration.

Currently, I work as a **Research and Development Engineer** specializing in **additive manufacturing** and **mechanical design**. My role involves **3D design**, **technical drawings**, and optimizing product functionality through additive manufacturing techniques.

I contribute to **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)** projects, handling **CAD design (SolidWorks)**, BOM management, prototyping, assembly coordination, and manufacturer communication for part sourcing.

I am highly proficient in **SolidWorks**, with a strong focus on **CAD modeling**, **technical drawings**, and high-performance system design in **mechatronics and robotics**.
