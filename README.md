Amir Souhail

Engineer | Research & Development in Mechatronics | Soft Robotics | Additive Manufacturing



I am an engineer from Pakistan, currently living and working in Italy, with a strong background in **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** (University of Bradford) and a Master’s in **Mechanical Engineering** specializing in soft robotics. I bridge the gap between **electronics**, **mechanical design**, and **software** to create cutting-edge robotic systems.

During my Master’s, I focused on **designing** soft robotic grippers for rehabilitation and material manipulation, igniting my passion for **flexible and adaptive robotic solutions**. At the Italian Institute of Technology, I advanced research on **variable stiffness in soft robotics**, which included **3D modeling**, simulating mechanical and thermal behaviors, testing materials, and integrating electronics.

Currently, I work as a **Research and Development Engineer** specializing in **additive manufacturing** and **mechanical design**. My role involves **3D designing** components, creating **technical drawings**, and optimizing product functionality through additive manufacturing techniques.

I contribute to **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)** projects, where I handle **3D design** and prototyping using **SolidWorks**, manage the BOM, oversee assembly processes, and coordinate with manufacturers for part sourcing.

I am proficient in **SolidWorks**, leveraging it extensively for **CAD modeling**, **technical drawings**, and developing high-performance systems. My expertise lies in designing innovative solutions in **mechatronics**, **robotics**, and **engineering design**.
